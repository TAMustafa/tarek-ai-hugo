# AI-Powered Freelancer Payout Crew
This Freelancer Payout Crew implemented using [CrewAI](https://crewai.ai), is a **multi-agent AI system** that automates the complete lifecycle of freelancer payments while aiming for regulatory compliance. It processes payout requests through six specialized agents, each responsible for a specific aspect of the payment flow.

## The Business Challenge
Managing payments for a global freelance workforce is a complex, manual, and time-consuming operation. Finance teams are burdened with:

**Compliance Risks**: Manually screening for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations and international sanctions is error-prone.

**Operational Inefficiency**: Processing payouts involves multiple steps: data validation, FX conversion, payment method selection, and execution.

**High Costs**: Suboptimal currency exchange and payment method selection eat into margins.

**Audit Headaches**: Creating a clear, defensible audit trail for regulators is a time-consuming manual process.

## Technical Architecture at a Glance
This automation system is built with CrewAI and orchestrates a sequential workflow where each specialist agent hands off its work to the next. All data is validated with type-safe **pydantic BaseModel** models, ensuring reliability and output consistency. It was built with a modular design in mind so that new payment methods or compliance rules can be added without disrupting the core system.

## Meet the CrewAI Team:
**The Data Validator**: Ingests and cleans possibly messy payout data, ensuring it meets strict standards before anything is processed.

**The Compliance Officer**: Automatically screens every payment against AML rules (e.g., blocking payments over €10,000) and international sanctions lists, providing a clear "approve" or "reject" decision with reasons.

**The FX Optimizer**: For cross-border payments, this agent is looking for the best available exchange rates, ensuring freelancers get more of their money and the company saves on fees.

**The Route Planner**: Intelligently selects the best payment method (**SEPA**, **Wise**, or **PayPal**) based on cost, speed, and the freelancer's location and banking details.

**The Executor**: Safely prepares the payment instructions for the chosen method, with built-in checks to prevent errors.

**The Auditor**: Meticulously records every action, decision, and reason, generating a complete audit trail that is ready for regulatory review.

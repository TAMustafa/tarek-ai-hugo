# ATS Resume Checker Chrome Extension

**Bridging the gap between qualified candidates and the Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that screen them.**

In today's competitive job market, a staggering number of resumes are rejected by automated systems before they ever reach a human. I built the **ATS Resume Matcher**‚Äîa full-stack application with a Chrome extension‚Äîto solve this critical pain point. This tool gives job seekers instant, actionable feedback to optimize their resumes for specific job descriptions, dramatically increasing their chances of landing an interview.

## üöÄ What It Does

The ATS Resume Matcher provides a dual interface for flexibility:

**Chrome Extension:** Analyze any job description directly from your browser. Simply paste your resume text and get immediate feedback without leaving the tab you're in.

The system provides a clear, visual breakdown, including:
*   **‚úÖ ATS Compatibility Score:** A precise score (0-100) rating your resume's alignment with the job description.
*   **üìä Key Matches & Missing Keywords:** Highlights the skills and experience that align perfectly, as well as critical keywords you're missing.
*   **üí° Actionable Improvement Suggestions:** Data-driven recommendations on how to bridge the gaps identified in your resume.

> **The Result?** A strategic, data-backed method for resume tailoring. No more guessing what the ATS is looking for‚Äîget the insights you need in seconds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Deep Dive

This full-stack project demonstrates expertise across the development lifecycle, from concept to a deployed, functional tool.

### **Frontend & Interfaces**
*   **Chrome Extension:** Built with **Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, & CSS** using **Manifest V3** for modern security and performance.

### **Backend API & AI Core**
*   **Framework:** **FastAPI (Python)** to serve high-performance, auto-documented endpoints with built-in validation.
*   **AI & NLP:** Leverages **pydantic-a- multi agents** to perform a intelligent similarity analysis between the resume and job description.
*   **Performance & Security:** Implements **caching** for a faster user experience and secure file upload handling for PDF processing.

### **Deployment**
*   **Containerization:** The entire application is **packaged with Docker** for consistent environments and easy deployment.


## üí° The Motivation & Impact

This project was born from a desire to tackle a real-world problem with a practical, user-centric solution. It's more than just code; it's a tool with a purpose. It showcases:

*   **Product Mindset:** Identifying a widespread user frustration and building multiple interfaces (Chrome Extension + Web App) to address it effectively.
*   **Full-Stack Proficiency:** Seamlessly integrating a browser extension, a web UI, a scalable Python API, and DevOps practices.
*   **Technical Rigor:** Features like detailed score breakdowns, downloadable JSON results, and PDF parsing demonstrate a commitment to building a robust and useful application.
